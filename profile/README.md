# GlasgowC3lab

The [Glasgow Carbon-Conscious Computing (GC3) lab](https://lauritzthamsen.org/lab/) is a new computer systems laboratory in the [Glasgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/#overview) and the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the University of Glasgow. The central aim of our research is to reduce the carbon footprint of large-scale data processing applications on today's diverse computing infrastructures. With this focus, our work falls into our School's newest research theme, [Low-Carbon and Sustainable Computing](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/lowcarbon/). 

Current lab members include:
- [James Nurdin](https://github.com/JamesNurdin/)
- [Lauritz Thamsen](https://github.com/lauritzthamsen/)
- [Kathleen West](https://github.com/westkath)
